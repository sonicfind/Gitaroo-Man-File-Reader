# Gitaroo-Man-File-Reader
Gitaroo Man File Reader is a wide-range (Windows-only) program for reading and editing the variety of file types found in the action rhythm games *Gitaroo Man* & *Gitaroo Man Lives*, released in 2001 for the PS2 & 2006 for the PSP respectively.

## Usage
Either simply open the application and follow the instructions to go through single files one-by-one or click and drag multiple files onto the .exe to process them all at once (does not support dragging a folder at this time).

## Filetype(s) Currently Supported
### CHC
These files are where the game stores and reads chart data. All info pertaining to sections and note placements will be found here, along with some other relevant data.
#### Sub-Extensions
* *`TAS`*: Adds the ability to convert any CHC file into a TAS file that can be played back in a (currently, only custom) build of PCSX2. PSP will be added later once those tools become available.
        
* *`Clone Hero`*: Adds the ability to export and import note data to/from the .chart format made for Guitar/Clone Hero. Utlizing the external .chart editor Moonscraper, this becomes a great avenue for easily editing charts.
